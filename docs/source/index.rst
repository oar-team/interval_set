Welcome to Interval Set's documentation!
========================================

This library is a simple way to describe and manage closed interval set
with native python object: a list of tuple. See the :ref:`library_doc` for
more details and examples.

This library was made to be simple and reliable. All functions are tested
against the examples given in the docstrings. You can run the test with
py.test like this::

  py.test -v --doctest-module interval_set

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
